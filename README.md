# 📊 Impact of May-2024 US Tariffs on Asset Returns

This project explores how the **May 2024 U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports** affected global equity and commodity markets — particularly companies operating in EVs, semiconductors, and critical minerals. By analyzing asset performance across multiple timeframes and sectors, the project demonstrates how macroeconomic trade policy decisions ripple through financial markets.

## 🧭 Objective

To analyze the short- and medium-term impact of U.S. tariff hikes on relevant equities and commodities using price and return data, and visualize the reaction using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 📅 Timeline

- **Tariff Announcement**: May 14, 2024  
- **Return Windows Analyzed**:  
  - 1 Day (May 15)  
  - 7 Days (May 21)  
  - 30 Days (June 14)
